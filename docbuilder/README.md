# Docbuilder for Velvet
This is a sub-project of the Velvet programming language which utilizes the Bun runtime in a typescript ecosystem to generate documentation automatically in `docs`.

Note that Bun is not a requirement to build Velvet as a whole like `llvm-sys` is.

This is a test project to provide minimal func signature documentation, and therefore it is not optimal in both readability and functionality.
